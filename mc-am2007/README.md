# Replication code of "Jacobian-free Efficient Pseudo-Likelihood (EPL) Algorithm" (Fukasawa, 2024)

This repository contains replication codes of the paper titled "Jacobian-free Efficient Pseudo-Likelihood (EPL) Algorithm" by Takeshi Fukasawa, proposing a novel and simple procedure to compute EPL estimator without coding Jacobians of the equilibrium constraint. 

We can run the numerical experiments by running the code mc_main.m.
