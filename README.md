# Replication code of "Jacobian-free Efficient Pseudo-Likelihood (EPL) Algorithm" (Fukasawa, 2024)

This repository contains the replication code of the paper titled "Jacobian-free Efficient Pseudo-Likelihood (EPL) Algorithm" by Takeshi Fukasawa, proposing a novel and simple procedure to compute the EPL estimator proposed by Dearing and Blevins (2024) without coding Jacobians of the equilibrium constraint. 

The code is based on the replication code of Dearing and Blevins (2024). In the code, we can validate the performance of the proposed Jacobian-free method in the setting first considered in Aguirregabiria and Mira (2007).

We can run all the numerical experiments shown in the paper by running mc_main.m in "mc-am2007" folder.
